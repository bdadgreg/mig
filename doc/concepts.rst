MIG is a platform to perform remote forensic on endpoints. It is composed of:

* Agent: a program that runs on endpoints and receives commands to run locally
  from the MIG platform. Commands are ran by agents using modules, such as
  'filechecker'.
* Scheduler: a router and processor that receives orders and forward them to
  agents
* API: an interface to the MIG platform used by investigators
* Clients: clients are used by investigators to interact with the MIG platform
  via the API
* Queue: a message queueing daemon that passes messages between the scheduler
  and the agents
* Database: a storage backend used by the scheduler and the api

Below is a high-level view of the different components:

Actions and Commands are messages passed between the differents components.

Actions and Commands
--------------------

Actions
~~~~~~~

Actions are JSON files created by investigator to perform tasks on agents.

For example, an investigator who wants to verify than root passwords are hashed
and salted on linux systems, would use the following action:

.. code:: json

	{
		"name": "Compliance check for Auditd",
		"description": {
			"author": "Julien Vehent",
			"email": "ulfr@mozilla.com",
			"url": "https://some_example_url/with_details",
			"revision": 201402071200
		},
		"target": "linux",
		"threat": {
			"level": "info",
			"family": "compliance"
		},
		"operations": [
			{
				"module": "filechecker",
				"parameters": {
					"/etc/shadow": {
						"regex": {
							"root password strongly hashed and salted": [
								"root:\\$(2a|5|6)\\$"
							]
						}
					}
				}
			}
		],
		"syntaxversion": 1
	}

The parameters are:

* Name: a string that represents the action.
* Target: a search string that will be used by the scheduler to find the agents
  the action will run on.
* Description and Threat: additional fields to describe the action
* Operations: an array of operations, each operation calls a module with a set
  of parameters. The parameters syntax are specific to the module.
* SyntaxVersion: indicator of the action format used. Should be set to 1.

Upon generation, additional fields are appended to the action:

* PGPSignature: all of the parameters above are concatenated into a string and
  signed with the investigator's private GPG key. The signature is part of the
  action, and used by agents to verify that an action comes from a trusted
  investigator.
* PGPSignatureDate: is the date of the PGP signature, used as a timestamp of
  the action creation.
* ValidFrom and ExpireAt: two dates that constrains the validity of the action
  to a time window.

Actions files are submitted to the API or the Scheduler directly. Eventually,
the PGP signature will be verified by intermediary components, and in any case
by each agent before execution.
Additional attributes are added to the action by the scheduler. Those are
defined as "MetaAction" and are used to track the action status.

Commands
~~~~~~~~

Upon processing of an Action, the scheduler will retrieve a list of agents to
send the action to. One action is then derived into Commands. A command contains an
action plus additional parameters that are specific to the target agent, such as
command processing timestamps, name of the agent queue on the message broker,
Action and Command unique IDs, status and results of the command. Below is an
example of the previous action ran against the agent named
'myserver1234.test.example.net'.

.. code:: json

	{
		"action":        { ... signed copy of action ... }
		"agentname":     "myserver1234.test.example.net",
		"agentqueueloc": "linux.myserver1234.test.example.net.55tjippis7s4t",
		"finishtime":    "2014-02-10T15:28:34.687949847Z",
		"id":            5978792535962156489,
		"results": [
			{
				"elements": {
					"/etc/shadow": {
						"regex": {
							"root password strongly hashed and salted": {
								"root:\\$(2a|5|6)\\$": {
									"Filecount": 1,
									"Files": {},
									"Matchcount": 0
								}
							}
						}
					}
				},
				"extra": {
					"statistics": {
						"checkcount": 1,
						"checksmatch": 0,
						"exectime": "183.237us",
						"filescount": 1,
						"openfailed": 0,
						"totalhits": 0,
						"uniquefiles": 0
					}
				},
				"foundanything": false
			}
		],
		"starttime": "2014-02-10T15:28:34.118926659Z",
		"status": "succeeded"
	}


The results of the command show that the file '/etc/shadow' has not matched,
and thus "FoundAnything" returned "false.
While the result is negative, the command itself has succeeded. Had a failure
happened on the agent, the scheduler would have been notified and the status
would be one of "failed", "timeout" or "cancelled".

Agent registration process
--------------------------

Agent upgrade process
---------------------
MIG supports upgrading agents in the wild. The upgrade protocol is designed with
security in mind. The flow diagram below presents a high-level view:

All upgrade operations are initiated by an investigator (1). The upgrade is
triggered by an action to the upgrade module with the following parameters:

.. code:: json

    "Operations": [
        {
            "Module": "upgrade",
            "Parameters": {
                "linux/amd64": {
                    "to_version": "16eb58b-201404021544",
                    "location": "http://localhost/mig/bin/linux/amd64/mig-agent",
                    "checksum": "31fccc576635a29e0a27bbf7416d4f32a0ebaee892475e14708641c0a3620b03"
                }
            }
        }
    ],

* Each OS family and architecture have their own parameters (ex: "linux/amd64",
  "darwin/amd64", "windows/386", ...). Then, in each OS/Arch group, we have:
* to_version is the version an agent should upgrade to
* location points to a HTTPS address that contains the agent binary
* checksum is a SHA256 hash of the agent binary to be verified after download

The parameters above are signed using a standard PGP action signature.

The upgrade action is forwarded to agents (2) like any other action. The action
signature is verified by the agent (3), and the upgrade module is called. The
module downloads the new binary (4), verifies the version and checksum (5) and
installs itself on the system.

Assuming everything checks in, the old agent executes the binary of the new
agent (6). At that point, two agents are running on the same machine, and the
rest of the protocol is designed to shut down the old agent, and clean up.

After executing the new agent, the old agent returns a successful result to the
scheduler, and includes its own PID in the results.
The new agent starts by registering with the scheduler (7). This tells the
scheduler that two agents are running on the same node, and one of them must
terminate. The scheduler sends a kill action to both agents with the PID of the
old agent (8). The kill action may be executed twice, but that doesn't matter.
When the scheduler receives the kill results (9), it sends a new action to check
for `mig-agent` processes (10). Only one should be found in the results (11),
and if that is the case, the scheduler tells the agent to remove the binary of
the old agent (12). When the agent returns (13), the upgrade protocol is done.

If the PID of the old agent lingers on the system, an error is logged for the
investigator to decide what to do next. The scheduler does not attempt to clean
up the situation.

Agent command execution flow
----------------------------

An agent receives a command from the scheduler on its personal AMQP queue (1).
It parses the command (2) and extracts all of the operations to perform.
Operations are passed to modules and executed asynchronously (3). Rather than
maintaining a state of the running command, the agent create a goroutine and a
channel tasked with receiving the results from the modules. Each modules
published its results inside that channel (4). The result parsing goroutine
receives them, and when it has received all of them, builds a response (5)
that is sent back to the scheduler(6).

When the agent is done running the command, both the channel and the goroutine
are destroyed.
